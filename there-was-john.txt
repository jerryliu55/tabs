          F#m                   B
I was the girl in the bubble at school
  Bm          E        A
Behind my own personal wall for protection
    F#m                    B
I'd sit there alone like a fool
  D         G       A
I never was able to make a connection

     F#m                         B
Then one day I tried out for the play
     D     E
I'll never forget it
  A
A flea in her ear
          F#m                   B
And I was suddenly someone with something to say
D             G       A
Making a sound everybody could hear

    F#m                 F#mM7
And suddenly everything made some sense
     F#m7                  B7
Then I saw this guy in the audience

    A         C#7
And there was John
                 F#m
Fifth row on the aisle
       B7
With a big smile on
    B         E       A        C#7
And after the show he came backstage
                  F#m                   B
And now that this birdie was out of her cage
      Bm              E
Well, everything was okay

              F#m                    B
We date for a year, then we're cohabitating
          Bm           D E       A         C#7
Then I get a big chance  to take  the next step
 F#m                  B
Away from a job I was hating
    Bm     E           A
And into a slot in the regional rep

     F#m                   F#mM7
In rehearsal all day after day after day
   F#m7                 B
Creating and playing in play after play
    D                    Dm
And night after night, igniting the spark
  F#m                        G
Connecting with all of those folks in the dark

    A        C#7
And John was there
             F#m                        B
There with a smile and his hands in the air
D              E         A         C#7
Clapping for me and back home we'd go
      F#m                        D#m
Happy together for eight or nine hours or so
    Bm              E
And everything was okay
    Bm7               E
And then I'd be gone again

     C                         F
This life takes everything you give it
       E
Like a puppy or a kid

[Julie & Dorothy]
    Am                         D
But if you really love it, you live it

[Julie]
    B
And that's what I did

C#            F#m                   B
Played Carousel on the road for the winter
     Bm       E              A       C#
From April to June, I toured Cabaret
            F#m                            B
Then Mother Courage in stock in New England all summer
    Bm                G           A      C#7
And John tried to call almost every day

   F#m                    F#mM7
He told me he wanted some kids and a wife
    F#m7
And that's when I realized
B7
This is my life
F#m                        G#m
I'd made my choice but I never expressed it
    F#m
And when I got home
        B
Can you guess?

[Dorothy, spoken]
Yeah, I guessed it

[Julie]
A        C#7
John was gone
                  F#m                    D#dim
Everything on the left of the closet was gone
     Bm                      G                     A
His electric guitar, and his amp, and his car were gone
     C#7
Just "poof"
            F#m              D#m
There I was standing under a roof alone
    D
And yes, my heart was almost broken
    Bm                         G
But I'd made my choice and I'd make it again

    C            E7
And now, where's John?
                  Am                     D
I think Portland, Maine or maybe it's Oregon
       Bb7
With a kid and a wife

    C       E7
And here is me
        Am                       D
Another dressing room number one thousand and three
 Dm7                   G
Exactly where I should be
 Dm7                    G
Exactly where we should be
    Fm            A#     C
And everything's okay
